## Out of the Box

### Parts

When you first receive your CharaChorder One, it will come in a black box with the CharaChorder logo on the outside. Once you open the box, you'll find your brand new CharaChorder One inside its carrying case. You will also find an insert that includes the layout of the device and some functions that the CharaChorder One has.

Once you unzip the travel case, you'll meet your shiny, new CharaChorder One. The CharaChorder One consists of two halves with 9, 5-way switches each, held together by a machined aluminum center bar. 

#### The Halves

Your device will come with two "halves" which comprise the full CharaChorder One. Each half corresponds to each hand and is designed for the ergonomics and comfort of each hand. The halves are printed by injection mold and made of ABS plastic. Each half is actually two pieces which are the dome-shaped "shell" and the flat and circular "baseplate". They are held together by 5 M3, CHECK INFO phillips screws which are under the "feet" of the device. The feet are round, rubberized CHECK INFO and help the device to have a grip on desks and other, smooth surfaces. 

The left half contains the "brain" of the device, where it stores chords, layouts, and settings. It also contains a female USB-C port on the left side of the half and a 3.5mm "audio jack" port on the right side of the half (See ##connections). The right half is nearly a mirror image of the left half. It has a 3.5mm "audio jack" port on the left side of the half and a no other ports (See ##connections). 

#### The Center Bar

Out of the box, your CharaChorder One will have a machined aluminum "bridge" which we can refer to as a metal bar. The metal bar is held in place by four M2x3mm screws, with two screws in each half. The metal bar is removable after having removed these four screws. 

#### The Switches

Instead of the one-dimensional buttons that traditional keyboards use, CharaChorder levers, which we will call switches, detect motion in three-dimensions so users have access to 90 unique inputs without their fingers breaking contact with the device. The CharaChorder One switches produce a digital input, as opposed to analog. Out of the nine switches, the six silver-colored switches are crafted with bead-blasted aluminum and the three black ones are made from ABS plastic.

Each CharaChorder half has nine 5-way switches. Starting from the outside on each half and working inwards, the switches correspond to the following fingers; pinky, ring, middle, and index. The three switches on the inner-most side of each half correspond to the thumb. You can see what characters are on each switch in #layout. Additionally, there are two black switches off the "home-row" which can be accessed by the ring and middle fingers.

Each switch has five pressable directions. Throughout this guide, we will use cardinal directions to refer to the directions in which each switch can move, with north being forward, away from your body. Switches can move north, south, west, east and down, into the device. Please be mindful that, as part of the device's ergonomics, each switch has a slightly different angle, so feel free to familiarize yourself with your new device.  ^ee8d9c

Out of all nine switches, the pinky switch stands out from the bunch. It's made to be flatter and wider than the other eight in order to make using it easier, since the pinky tends to be the finger with the least dexterity. 

Earlier, we mentioned the five directions in which a switch can be actuated, or pressed. Aside from the four cardinal directions, each switch can be pressed down, into the device. We often refer to this press as a 3D press, since it's not a lateral movement, but rather a movement along the Z axis of the switch. This special press requires no lateral movement in order to work, just apply force onto the switch "into" the device. Each of the five directions on a switch can be mapped to a configurable key, which can include letters, numbers, symbols, control keys and even function keys. You can see the most current list of configurable action codes in #action codes CHECK INFO.

### Connections

Your new CharaChorder One comes with two cables in the box; the power cable that goes out to the computer and the communication cable between the halves.

#### Power

The CharaChorder One is powered by a single, braided USB-C to USB-A cable, with both ends being male ends. The USB-C side of the cable fits into the USB-C port on the left side of the left half of the CharaChorder. The USB-A end of the cable is then plugged into your computer, or into a mobile device, usually with the help of an adapter. ^9cddb9

#### Communication

The Power Cable also doubles as a way for the CharaChorder One to communicate with your computer. For this reason, it's important that the USB-A end of the power cable is inserted into a port on your computer that's capable of sending and receiving data, and not just an energy port. 

In between the two CharaChorder halves, there's a single 3.5mm TRS CHECK INFO cable, commonly known as an AUX cable. This cable facilitates instant communication between the right half and the left half of the CharaChorder. However, as mentioned before, only the left half contains the "brain" of the CharaChorder which holds your chord library, layout, and settings. ^59e90e

### Plugging In

The CharaChorder One is plug-and-play, so it doesn't require any additional software to work. Before plugging your CharaChorder in for the first time, it's important to make sure that the [[#^59e90e|TRS cable]] is fully plugged into both halves. With constant movement, it's possible that this cable becomes slightly dislodged which could lead to issues with the device, so it's a good idea to check these connections when moving the CharaChorder to a new computer. 

If not done already, make sure that the USB-C side of the [[#^9cddb9|power cable]] is plugged into the left half of the CharaChorder. It's important to be certain that the cable is plugged all the way in, otherwise, the CharaChorder might not function as intended. 

>	***IMPORTANT: During your first time plugging your CharaChorder in, and every time thereafter when you have [[realtime feedback]] enabled, it's recommended that you have your cursor in a blank typing space. The CharaChorder has a welcome message that can send instructions to your computer that are not intended by the user. This feature can be disabled in the [[Generative Text Menu|GTM]].***

After making sure that all the cables on the CharaChorder are properly plugged in, connect the USB-A side of the [[#^9cddb9|power cable]] into a USB-A port on your computer. Upon connecting, you may notice the following things:
- If your cursor is somewhere where text can be entered...
	- You will first see the text "Loading ### Chordmaps" highlighted, and a few moments later, "CCOS is ready." 
- Regardless of whether or not your cursor is somewhere where text can be entered...
	- You will be able to see a small, lime colored light inside the space that holds the USB-C port on the left half of the CharaChorder One. 

If you have [[realtime feedback]] enabled, once you can see the highlighted text that reads "CCOS is ready", your device is ready to be used.

>	***IMPORTANT: [[Realtime feedback]] is enabled by default on new CharaChorder devices.***

## Getting Started

There are a few steps that you'll likely want to take if this is your first time using your CharaChorder device. In the following section, we will update your device, explain the settings found in the [[Generative Text Menu (GTM)|GTM]], and demonstrate the default layout on your new device.

### Updating your Device

>	***IMPORTANT: If your device shipped from our warehouse before 2023, it's possible that it is running an obsolete firmware. You can read instructions on how to upgrade your device to our new CCOS [[Upgrade to CCOS|here]].*** If your device is not running [[CharaChorder Operating System (CCOS)|CCOS]], you will be unable to follow the steps below to update your device.

#### Checking your Device's Firmware

You can check your device's current firmware by following the steps below:
1. On a chromium based browser, such as Chrome, go to the CharaChorder [[Device Manager]] (https://www.iq-eq.io/#/manager)
2. Click "Connect"
3.  When the popup box comes up that reads "www.iq-eq.io wants to connect to a serial port", choose your CharaChorder device, then click the blue "connect" button
After following the above steps, you can find your firmware version right above the "Connect" button. It will read something like this:
			`Device ID CHARACHORDER ONE M0 --- CCOS VERSION 1.0.1`

#### Updating the Firmware

If you find that your device is not running the latest firmware version, you can follow the steps below to update your device. You can check which is the latest firmware release by visiting [this site](www.google.com).
1. On a chromium based browser, such as Chrome, go to the CharaChorder [[Device Manager]] (https://www.iq-eq.io/#/manager)
2. Click "Connect"
3.  When the popup box comes up that reads "www.iq-eq.io wants to connect to a serial port", choose your CharaChorder device, then click the blue "connect" button
4. Click "Bootloader". Your CharaChorder will now appear as an external storage device on your computer's file explorer or Finder app. It might be named one of the following: "Arduino", "Seeduino", or "CharaChorder One". ^f22991
5. Download your update file from this site: INSERT SITE LINK
>	***IMPORTANT: Make sure that the file you download is named exactly like this: CURRENT.UF2 . If there are any other characters in the file name, the file will not work. "CURRENT.UF2(1)" will NOT work. Additionally, the file name is case sensitive; all letters must be capitalized.
6. Copy the CURRENT.UF2 file that you just downloaded and paste it into the CharaChorder drive that we found in [[#^f22991|step 4]]
7. When your computer asks you how you would like to resolve the issue of two files with the same name, select "Replace file".
At this point, your CharaChorder One will automatically reboot and the CharaChorder drive will have disappeared. Congratulations! You have successfully updated your device. You can check your device's firmware version by following the steps [[#Checking your Device's Firmware|here]].   

### Understanding the Settings

The CharaChorder One has settings that are user-configurable. Since the device is plug-and-play, you don't need any software to edit the device's settings; all you need is a place to type text. We call these settings the Generative Text Menu, or GTM for short.

You can access the [[Generative Text Menu (GTM)|GTM]] by [[chording]] both pinkies [[#^ee8d9c|north]] on any space that allows text entry such as a notepad app. For an explanation on chords and how to perform them, visit the [[Chords]] section. 

Once you perform the chord to call up the [[Generative Text Menu (GTM)|GTM]], your CharaChorder will type out the menu and its options. It will look something like this: 
        ` CharaChorder GTM [ >K<eyboard || >M<ouse || >C<hording || >D<isplay || >R<esources ]`

Navigation around this menu is based on letter-presses. In the example above, you can select the desired submenu by pressing the letter between the angle brackets (for example: `>K<`) in your target submenu on your CharaChorder One. In the example above, you would press `K` for Keyboard, `M` for Mouse, `C` for Chording, `D` for Display, and `R` for Resources.

In some submenus, you will see numeric values. In order to increase or decrease these, you can use the arrow keys on your CharaChorder One. 
		` CharaChorder > Chording > Press Tolerance [ Use up/down arrow keys to adjust: 25ms ]`
