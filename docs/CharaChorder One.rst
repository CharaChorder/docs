When you first receive your CharaChorder One, it will come in a black
box with the CharaChorder logo on the outside. Once you open the box,
you’ll find your brand new CharaChorder One inside its carrying case.
You will also find an insert that includes the layout of the device and
some functions that the CharaChorder One has.

.. _CC1 Case:

  :width: 1200
  :alt: CharaChorder One Travel Case

Once you unzip the travel case, you’ll meet your shiny, new CharaChorder
One. The CharaChorder One consists of two halves with 9, 5-way switches
each, held together by a machined aluminum center bar.

The Halves
~~~~~~~~~~

Your device will come with two “halves” which comprise the full
CharaChorder One. Each half corresponds to each hand and is designed for
the ergonomics and comfort of each hand. The halves are printed by
injection mold and made of ABS plastic. Each half is actually two pieces
which are the dome-shaped “shell” and the flat and circular “baseplate”.
They are held together by 5 M2, Philips screws which are
under the “feet” of the device. The feet are round, rubberized and help the device to have a grip on desks and other smooth
surfaces.

The left half contains the “brain” of the device, where it stores
chords, layouts, and settings. It also contains a female USB-C port on
the left side of the half and a 3.5mm “audio jack” port on the right
side of the half (See :ref:`Connections<Connections>`). The right half is nearly a mirror
image of the left half. It has a 3.5mm “audio jack” port on the left
side of the half and a no other ports (See :ref:`Connections<Connections>`).

The Center Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Out of the box, your CharaChorder One will have a machined aluminum
“bridge” which we can refer to as a metal bar. The metal bar is held in
place by four M2x3mm screws, with two screws in each half. The metal bar
is removable after having removed these four screws.

The Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of the one-dimensional buttons that traditional keyboards use,
CharaChorder levers, which we will call switches, detect motion in
three-dimensions so users have access to 90 unique inputs without their
fingers breaking contact with the device. The CharaChorder One switches
produce a digital input, as opposed to analog. Out of the nine switches,
the six silver-colored switches are crafted with bead-blasted aluminum
and the three black ones are made from ABS plastic.

Each CharaChorder half has nine 5-way switches. Starting from the
outside on each half and working inwards, the switches correspond to the
following fingers; pinky, ring, middle, and index. The three switches on
the inner-most side of each half correspond to the thumb. You can see
what characters are on each switch in :doc:`Layout<Layout>`. Additionally,
there are two black switches off the “home-row” which can be accessed by
the ring and middle fingers.

.. note::
   **IMPORTANT**: In this manual, we will refer to switches in the
   following way, starting from the pinky finger and working inwards:
   pinky, ring, middle, index, thumb 1, thumb 2, thumb 3. The black
   switches below the “home-row” will be referred to as the arrow and
   mouse switches, where the switch further to the left on the left half
   of the CharaChorder is the mouse switch. Symmetrically, the mouse
   switch is the switch furthest to the right on the right half.

Each switch has five press-able directions. Throughout this guide, we
will use cardinal directions to refer to the directions in which each
switch can move, with _`north` being forward, away from your body. Switches
can move north, south, west, east and down, into the device. Please be
mindful that, as part of the device’s ergonomics, each switch has a
slightly different angle, so feel free to familiarize yourself with your
new device.

Out of all nine switches, the pinky switch stands out from the bunch.
It’s made to be flatter and wider than the other eight in order to make
using it easier, since the pinky tends to be the finger with the least
dexterity.

Earlier, we mentioned the five directions in which a switch can be
actuated, or pressed. Aside from the four cardinal directions, each
switch can be pressed down, into the device. We often refer to this
press as a 3D press, since it’s not a lateral movement, but rather a
movement along the Z axis of the switch. This special press requires no
lateral movement in order to work, just apply force onto the switch
“into” the device. Each of the five directions on a switch can be mapped
to a configurable key, which can include letters, numbers, symbols,
control keys and even function keys. You can see the most current list
of configurable action codes in `action
codes <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--T9bXshCIC-OVly-CY3rK87fgb7AHgJl3IySh7cmHc/edit#gid=0>`__.

Connections
-----------

Your new CharaChorder One comes with two cables in the box; the power
cable that goes out to the computer and the communication cable between
the halves.

Power
~~~~~

The CharaChorder One is powered by a single, braided USB-C to USB-A
cable, with both ends being male ends. The USB-C side of the cable fits
into the USB-C port on the left side of the left half of the
CharaChorder. The USB-A end of the cable is then plugged into your
computer, or into a mobile device, usually with the help of an adapter.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _power cable:
The Power Cable also doubles as a way for the CharaChorder One to
communicate with your computer. For this reason, it’s important that the
USB-A end of the power cable is inserted into a port on your computer
that’s capable of sending and receiving data, and not just an energy
port.

.. _TRS cable:
In between the two CharaChorder halves, there’s a single 3.5mm TRS cable, commonly known as an AUX cable. This cable facilitates
instant communication between the right half and the left half of the
CharaChorder. However, as mentioned before, only the left half contains
the “brain” of the CharaChorder which holds your chord library, layout,
and settings.

Plugging In
-----------

The CharaChorder One is plug-and-play, so it doesn’t require any
additional software to work. Before plugging your CharaChorder in for
the first time, it’s important to make sure that the :ref:`TRS cable<TRS cable>` is fully plugged into both halves. With constant movement, it’s
possible that this cable becomes slightly dislodged which could lead to
issues with the device, so it’s a good idea to check these connections
when moving the CharaChorder to a new computer.

If not done already, make sure that the USB-C side of the
:ref:`power cable<power cable>` is plugged into the left half of the
CharaChorder. It’s important to be certain that the cable is plugged all
the way in, otherwise, the CharaChorder might not function as intended.

.. warning::
   IMPORTANT: During your first time plugging your CharaChorder in,
   and every time thereafter when you have :ref:`realtime feedback<Realtime Feedback>`
   enabled, it’s recommended
   that you have your cursor in a blank typing space. The CharaChorder
   has a welcome message that can send instructions to your computer
   that are not intended by the user. This feature can be disabled in
   the :doc:`GTM<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>`. 

After making sure that all the cables on the CharaChorder are properly
plugged in, connect the USB-A side of the :ref:`power cable<power cable>` into
a USB-A port on your computer. Upon connecting, you may notice the
following things: - If your cursor is somewhere where text can be
entered… - You will first see the text “Loading ### Chordmaps”
highlighted, and a few moments later, “CCOS is ready.” - Regardless of
whether or not your cursor is somewhere where text can be entered… - You
will be able to see a small, lime colored light inside the space that
holds the USB-C port on the left half of the CharaChorder One.

If you have :ref:`realtime feedback<Realtime Feedback>` enabled, once you can see the highlighted text that reads
“CCOS is ready”, your device is ready to be used.

.. note::
   IMPORTANT: :ref:`Realtime feedback<Realtime Feedback>` is enabled by default on new CharaChorder devices.

Getting Started
*******************

There are a few steps that you’ll likely want to take if this is your
first time using your CharaChorder device. In the following section, we
will update your device, explain navigation in the :doc:`GTM<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>`, and demonstrate the default layout on your new
device.

Updating your Device
--------------------

.. warning::
   IMPORTANT: If your device shipped from our warehouse before 2023,
   it’s possible that it is running an obsolete firmware. You can read
   instructions on how to upgrade your device to our new CCOS :doc:`here<Upgrade to CCOS>`. If your device is not running    :doc:`CCOS<CharaChorder Operating System (CCOS)>`, you will be unable to follow the
   steps below to update your device.

Checking your Device’s Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check your device’s current firmware by following the steps
below: 

#. On a chromium based browser, such as Chrome, go to the CharaChorder `Device Manager <https://www.iq-eq.io/#/manager>`__ 
#. Click “Connect” 
#. When the popup box comes up that reads “www.iq-eq.io wants to connect to a serial port”, choose your CharaChorder device, then click the blue “connect” button

After following the above steps, you can find your
firmware version right above the “Connect” button. It will read
something like this:

  :alt: Checking the firmware on DOT I/O

Updating the Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find that your device is not running the latest firmware version,
you can follow the steps below to update your device. You can check
which is the latest firmware release by visiting `this
site <https://www.charachorder.com/pages/update-your-firmware>`__. 

.. warning::
   IMPORTANT: Before performing the below steps, please make sure that you have a :doc:`backup of your layout<Backups>`      as well as a :doc:`backup of your chord library<Backups>`. The update might reset those, so it's important that you    keep backup files handy. For instructions on how to restore backed up files, visit the :doc:`Backups<Backups>`    section. The update might also reset some of your :ref:`GTM<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>` settings. Be sure to write    down settings before you update.

#. On a chromium based browser, such as Chrome, go to the CharaChorder `Device Manager <https://www.iq-eq.io/#/manager>`__ 
#. Click “Connect”
#. When the popup box comes up that reads “www.iq-eq.io wants to connect to a serial port”, choose your CharaChorder device, then click the blue “connect” button
#. _`Click` “Bootloader”. Your CharaChorder will now appear as an external storage device on your computer’s file explorer or Finder app. It might be named one of the following: “Arduino”, “Seeduino”, or “CharaChorder One”.
#. Download your update file from this site: `<https://www.charachorder.com/pages/update-your-firmware>`__

.. warning::
   ***IMPORTANT: Make sure that the file you download is named exactly
   like this: CURRENT.UF2 . If there are any other characters in the
   file name, the file will not work. “CURRENT.UF2(1)” will NOT work.
   Additionally, the file name is case sensitive; all letters must be
   capitalized.

6. Copy the CURRENT.UF2 file that you just downloaded and paste it into the CharaChorder drive that we found in :ref:`step 4<Click>`
7. When your computer asks you how you would like to resolve the issue of two files with the same name, select “Replace file”.

At this point, your CharaChorder One will automatically reboot and the
CharaChorder drive will have disappeared. Congratulations! You have
successfully updated your device. You can check your device’s firmware
version by following the steps :ref:`here<Checking your Device’s Firmware>`.

Understanding the Settings
--------------------------

The CharaChorder One has settings that are user-configurable. Since the
device is plug-and-play, you don’t need any software to edit the
device’s settings; all you need is a place to type text. We call these
settings the Generative Text Menu, or GTM for short.

You can access the :doc:`GTM<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>` by
:doc:`chording<Chords>` both pinkies `north`_ on any space that
allows text entry such as a notepad app. For an explanation on chords
and how to perform them, visit the :doc:`Chords<Chords>` section.

Once you perform the chord to call up the :doc:`GTM<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>`, your CharaChorder will type out the menu and its options.
It will look something like this:


``CharaChorder GTM [ >K<eyboard || >M<ouse || >C<hording || >D<isplay || >R<esources ]``

Navigation around this menu is based on letter-presses. In the example
above, you can select the desired submenu by pressing the letter between
the angle brackets (for example: ``>K<``) in your target submenu on your
CharaChorder One. In the example above, you would press ``K`` for
Keyboard, ``M`` for Mouse, ``C`` for Chording, ``D`` for Display, and
``R`` for Resources.

In some submenus, you will see numeric values. In order to increase or
decrease these, you can use the arrow keys on your CharaChorder One.

``CharaChorder > Chording > Press Tolerance [ Use up/down arrow keys to adjust: 25ms ]``

You can read an explanation on all of the settings on your CharaChorder device :doc:`here<Generative Text Menu (GTM)>`.

Learning the Layout
-------------------

The default CharaChorder layout, which we will refer to as the CC
English layout, has been designed to favor :doc:`bigrams<Logic behind the Layout>` and :doc:`trigrams<Logic behind the Layout>` commonly used in the English language while making the letters accessible for a logical choice of :doc:`lexical<Chords>`. You can find the map below.

.. _CCEnglish Layout:
.. image:: /assets/images/CCEnglish.png
  :width: 1200
  :alt: CC English Layout

Layers
~~~~~~

The CharaChorder One has 3 layers: the base layer called the A1 layer,
the secondary layer referred to as A2, and the tertiary layer named A3.
Being as the CharaChorder One has 9 switches on each half, and taking
into account that each switch can access 5 different positions, and
considering that each layer has access to all of those 9 switches, we
have over 250 assignable slots between the two CharaChorder halves.

In this section, we’ll refer only to the default CC English layout. If
you have modified your layout to something different, then the next
portion might not be accurate for your device. If you have purchased
your device from CharaChorder, then the following is accurate to your
device.

A1 Layer
^^^^^^^^

The A1 layer is the main layer that is active by default. The CC English
layout has all 26 letters of the English alphabet on the A1 layer so
that you can access all of them without having to hold or press anything
else. Your device will always be in the A1 layer upon boot.

While the A1 layer is active on the CharaChorder One by default, you can
map the A1 access key, which bears the name “KM_1_R” or “KM_1_L”, on the
:doc:`CharaChorder-Config<Tools>` site or by
:doc:`editing the layout csv and importing it onto your device<Remapping>`.

A2 Layer
^^^^^^^^

The A2 layer, sometimes referred to as the “number layer”, is accessible
with the :doc:`A2 access key<CharaChorder Keys>`. In the above :ref:`graphic<CCEnglish Layout>`, you’ll see this labeled
as “num-shift.” In the `Key remapping reference
guide <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--T9bXshCIC-OVly-CY3rK87fgb7AHgJl3IySh7cmHc/edit#gid=0>`__,
this key has the name “KM_2_L” and “KM_2_R”, one for each side of the
CharaChorder. Additionally, on the webtool
:doc:`CharaChorder-Config<Tools>`, this key is also
assignable by the names “KM_2_L” and “KM_2_R”.

By default, the A2 Layer is accessible by pressing and holding either
pinky finger outwards, that is, west on the left pinky or east on the
right pinky. You do not have to hold them both, only one is required.
Any key that is on the A2 Layer can only be accessed by pressing and
holding the A2 Layer access key along with the target key. You do not
need to :doc:`chord<Chords>` the keys together; it’s only required that the
A2 Layer access key is pressed while the target key is pressed.

.. note::
   EXAMPLE: On the CC English layout, you can access the number
   ``4`` by pressing and holding the right pinky to the east and the
   left middle finger to the east.

A3 Layer
^^^^^^^^

The A3 layer, sometimes referred to as the “function layer”, is
accessible with the :ref:`A3 access key<CharaChorder Keys>`. This key is not
in the above :ref:`graphic<CCEnglish Layout>`, and instead
is accessible by pressing and holding either pinky down, into the
device. In the `Remapping Reference Guide <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--T9bXshCIC-OVly-CY3rK87fgb7AHgJl3IySh7cmHc/edit#gid=0>`__,
this key has the name “KM_3_L” and “KM_3_R”, one for each side of the
CharaChorder. Additionally, on the webtool :doc:`CharaChorder-Config<Tools>`, this key is also
assignable by the names “KM_3_L” and “KM_3_R”.

By default, the A3 Layer is accessible by pressing and holding either
pinky finger down. You do not have to hold them both in order to access
the A3 layer. Any key that is on the A3 Layer can only be accessed by
pressing and holding the :doc:`A3 access key<CharaChorder Keys>`,
along with the target key. You do not need to :doc:`chord<Chords>` the keys
together; it’s only required that the A3 layer access key is pressed
while the target key is pressed.

.. note::
   EXAMPLE: On the CC English layout, you can access the F1 key by
   pressing and holding either pinky down, into the device.

Shift Modifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On top of the three aforementioned layers, the :doc:`Shift key<CharaChorder Keys>`, which is a :doc:`modifier<Glossary>`, can be used to access some extra keys. The Shift keypress works just like it
would on a traditional keyboard. You can capitalize letters and access
symbols attached to numbers. This works with any key on any layer, just
like other modifiers (such as Ctrl and Alt). The Shift modifier output
is currently controlled by the Operating System that your CharaChorder is
plugged to, and it is not possible to customize their outputs.

In the above [[CharaChorder One layout card.webp|graphic]], you’ll see
the Shift key labeled as “Shift”. In the `Key Remapping Reference Guide <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--T9bXshCIC-OVly-CY3rK87fgb7AHgJl3IySh7cmHc/edit#gid=0>`__,
this key has the name “Left_Shift” and “Right_Shift”, one for each side
of the CharaChorder. Additionally, on the webtool
:doc:`CharaChorder-config<Tools>`, this key is also
assignable by the names “Left_Shift” and “Right_Shift”.

By default, the Shift is accessible by pressing and holding either pinky
finger inwards, that is, east on the left pinky or west on the right
pinky. You do not have to hold them both, only one is required. Any key
that requires the Shift Modifier can only be accessed by pressing and
holding the Shift key along with the target key. You do not need to
:doc:`chord<Chords>` the keys together; it’s only required that the Shift
key is pressed while the target key is pressed.

.. note::
   EXAMPLE: On the CC English layout, you can access the capital
   ``A`` by pressing and holding the left pinky to the east and the
   right index finger to the west.

   On the CC English layout, you can access the ``@`` symbol by pressing
   and holding both pinkies to the east and the left index south.

Configurability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CharaChorder One’s layout is configurable, which means that you can
:doc:`remap<Glossary>` almost all keys. Though the CC English
layout has been optimized for writing in English by
:doc:`chentry<Glossary>` and :doc:`chording<Chords>`, some users may
choose to :doc:`remap<Glossary>` their device’s layout to better
suit their personal needs. For a thorough explanation on how remapping
works and how to remap your device, visit the :doc:`remapping section<Remapping>`
