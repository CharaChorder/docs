General FAQs
------------
Where can I talk to other CharaChorder users?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our biggest online communities are located on:

- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/hYu6VW5YkM  
- **YouTube**: https://www.youtube.com/charachorder  

Is it really faster than QWERTY?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, any chording-enabled device text entry will indeed type much faster than typing one letter at a time. This is due to the laws of physics rather than the skill level of any individual user.

Is it comfortable to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, many users utilize CharaChorder Two purely for the ergonomic benefits. By using a broader range of muscles, repetitive strain is reduced.

How does chording work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To output an entire word or sentence simultaneously, you ‘chord’ by pressing and releasing multiple inputs at the same time.

What about words with the same letters as another word?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the case of an anagramic chord, there are various workarounds, such as:
- Chord modifiers
- Compound chords
- Briefs

Is this stenography?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It’s more like a keyboard/mouse hybrid combined with a steno writer on steroids. CharaChorder offers both high-speed character entry and ultra-high-speed chording.
