   3D Press
      When a switch is activated by pushing it normal to the surface of the 
      device (same as an ordinary keyboard switch).

   Active Mode
      Nudges your mouse one pixel every minute or so to keep your computer 
      from sleeping.
    
   Ambidextrous Throwover (aka Mirror Mode)
      Entry mode designed for one-handed typing. Characters from the opposite 
      hand are mirrored to the hand which activates this feature.

   Arpeggiate
      A quick, single key press and release to indicate a suffix, prefix, or
      modifier to be associated with a chord.
   
   Chentry
      Shorthand for 'character entry', or typing on a chording-enabled device
      letter by letter.
      
   Chord Modifiers
      Inputs which, when included with a chord, change the prefix, suffix,
      capitalization, conjugation, part of speech, language, or structure of a chord.  Note, these can be used arpeggiately. 
      
   Compound Chords
      Multiple chords which behave differently when used together in context
      (not yet user programmable). Example: know + ledge = knowledge.

   Cursor Warping
      When your cursor or mouse position moves ("warps") based on a chord.
      Example: Chord " with DUP to create "" and warp your cursor inside "".

   DUP (duplicate) key
      In character entry, it repeats your last input. In chorded entry, it is
      used for words with repeating letters.

   Forced Chord Phenomenon
      The experience of typing a word in character entry feeling unnatural due
      to the development of muscle memory for chording that word.

   Fluid Chorded/Character Entry
      Default text entry mode for CharaChorder. Output characters individually
      (like a keyboard) OR press and release multiple characters of a chord 
      simultaneously to output a chord.

   GTM (Generative Text Menu)
      A text-based menu accessible anywhere you type. It allows access to 
      various device settings and features without software. See :doc:`GenerativeTextMenu`.

   Impulse Chord
      An 'on-the-fly' custom chord that can be spontaneously created anywhere
      you can type via the GTM. See :ref:`Chords:Impulse chording`.

   Macro
      Sequence of mouse and/or keyboard actions assigned to a chord.

   Spurring
      A 'chording only' mode which outputs chords on a press rather than a
      press & release. Enables jumping from one chord to another without 
      releasing everything. It can provide significant speed gains with chording, 
      but also takes away the flexibility of character entry. Spurring also 
      helps new users learn how to chord by eliminating the need to focus on 
      timing.
