Serial API
==========

The Serial API allows users and developers to interact with their CCOS powered device over a serial connection.  This can be used to add and remove chords, change advanced parameters, and perform common commands such as resetting keymaps or resetting the device to factory settings. You can utilize this serial API by using any serial terminal such as `serialterminal.com <https://www.serialterminal.com/>`_ on a `serial enabled web browser <https://caniuse.com/web-serial>`_. The serial connection operates at a baud rate of 115200 bps. In general, a success returns a 0 at the end, while a failure returns a number greater than zero, which represents an error code. When sending Serial API commands to a CharaChorder device, allow for at least 100 microseconds (us) between commands to allow time for the commands to be processed on the device. If there is no time allowed to process commands on the device, then the serial input buffer on the device can fill up and overflow, causing a system crash. Ideally, sequential Serial API commands should be called in a restful manner by waiting for a response from the previous command.

.. warning::
   Parameter and keymaps changes, when **committed**, will degrade the flash chip over time (generally a minimum of 10,000 to 25,000 commits are expected to be stable). If you use the commands below, keep in mind that if you accidentally write a program that unnecessarily commits parameters to your device you can wear it out prematurely.  If you plan to programmatically change layouts, for example, you shouldnâ€™t commit the changes unless you need them to persist after power loss. 

   Chords are stored on external flash and have a minimum of 100,000 commits before any degradation could be expected; however, we have a custom wear leveling algorithm that targets specific sectors so this should extend much farther and is less of a concern.

Commands Overview
-----------------

Commands are all caps ASCII characters. The return is always one line and includes the command in the return line along with some of the relevant input arguments as well. This makes it more restful and stateless as compared to previous versions of the Serial API.

Commands
-----------------
This section covers the various commands, what they expect, what they return, and has examples of how to use them. 

CMD
~~~

The `CMD` command lists out all of the commands in the Serial API. All of the commands are returned in one comma-delimited line. All commands are uppercase ASCII characters.

RST
~~~

The `RST` command restarts the CCOS device. This will most likely also break the current Serial connection, and a new connection will need to be made. If the `COMMIT` command has not been called before a `RESTART` command, then the device will revert to the last settings stored in the non-volatile memory.

   "OUTPUT","0","Command","Chars","RST","Without optional command, this just restarts the device"

RST SubCommands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table::
   :header: "RST SubCommand","Notes"

   "RESTART","Restarts the microcontroller."
   "FACTORY","Performs a factory reset of the flash and emulated eeprom. During the process, the flash chip is erased."
   "BOOTLOADER","Restarts the device into a bootloader mode. On a CC1 or CCL M0, the device may be stuck in UF2 bootloader mode until a UF2 file is pasted into the mass storage device. You can copy and paste the UF2 file already in the mass storage device."
   "PARAMS","Resets the parameters to factory defaults and commits."
   "KEYMAPS","Resets the keymaps to the factory defaults and commits."
   "STARTER","Adds starter chordmaps. This does not clear the chordmap library, but adds to it, replacing those that have the same chord."
   "CLEARCML","Permanently deletes all the chordmaps stored in the device memory."
   "UPGRADECML","Attempts to upgrade chordmaps that the system detects are older. This is under development."
   "FUNC","Adds back in functional chords such as CAPSLOCKS and Backspace-X chords."


RAM
~~~

The `RAM` command returns the current number of bytes availabe in SRAM. This is useful for debugging when there is a suspected heap or stack issue.

Chord Construction
------------------

There are 128-bits in a chord. The first 8 bits will typically be 0x00, as this byte value is used to store an index value for chordmaps where the chord output is longer than what can be stored in memory in a single chordmap, which has 192 bytes allocated per memory entry.

The next 120-bit bits are segmented into twelve 10-bit chunks. Each 10-bit value is a 10-bit CC action code. While CC action codes can reference up to 13-bits, only up to 10-bit values can be used for key inputs. The key inputs for a chord are sorted in descending order from greatest in value to least in value.

Note that yes it is possible to use the same CC action code multiple times for keys in a chord, but these chords cannot be activated unless the device's keymap has more than one instance of the same CC action code assigned to more than one of the keys on the A1 keymap layer.

If a chord is attempted to be formed by more than 12 keys, then the smallest key values after being sorted should be truncated to just 12 values. This chord bit structure can not support more than twelve 10-bit keys.
Most chords will have trailing zeros.

To use these chords with the Serial API, they should be converted to a 16-character hexadecimal representation.
